# TO DO List
A simple but functional to do list using a web browser. The list starts out empty. When the user enters a to do item into the list and hits the plus, it is added into the to do category. When the user clicks on the check, the item moves into the done category. If the user hits the trash, the item is deleted. 

### Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Adobe Illustrator

### To be added:
In the future I will connect the application to a mysql database, so the items can be tracked.
